The duration for which you should continue taking BPC-157 can vary based on your specific goals and response to the peptide. Since you're using it for tissue repair and wound healing, many individuals use it for a period ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on their recovery progress.

It's essential to monitor how your body responds and consult with a healthcare professional who can evaluate your situation and provide personalized guidance. They can help determine the appropriate duration based on your healing progress and any potential side effects. Remember, because BPC-157 is not FDA-approved for human use, it should be used under medical supervision to ensure safety and efficacy.
