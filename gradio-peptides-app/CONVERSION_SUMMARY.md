## 👥 Demo Users Configuration

| User | ID | Name | Email | Focus Area |
|------|----|----|-------|------------|
| john | john_demo_user | John Smith | john@healthcoach.ai | New to peptide therapy |
| jane | jane_demo_user | Jane Doe | jane@healthcoach.ai | Experienced with BPC-157 |
| jarvis | jarvis_demo_user | Jarvis Wilson | jarvis@healthcoach.ai | Gut health improvement |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Framework Migration
```python
# Streamlit → Gradio
import streamlit as st          →  import gradio as gr
st.sidebar.selectbox()          →  gr.Dropdown()
st.tabs()                       →  gr.Tabs()
st.chat_message()               →  gr.Chatbot()
st.session_state                →  gr.State()
st.button().on_click            →  button.click()
```

### Event Handling
**Streamlit:** Reactive programming with automatic reruns  
**Gradio:** Event-driven programming with explicit handlers

### State Management
**Streamlit:** Built-in session state  
**Gradio:** Manual state management with gr.State components
