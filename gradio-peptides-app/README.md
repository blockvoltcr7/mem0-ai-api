## üìñ Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Select a Demo User**: Choose from John, Jane, or Jarvis
2. **Login**: Click the login button to authenticate
3. **Choose Your Path**:
   - **Start Chatting Immediately**: Ask questions for general peptide therapy advice
   - **Complete Health Profile**: Fill out the questionnaire for personalized recommendations
   - **Skip Profile**: Use the skip button to chat with general advice

### Flexible Profile Management
The application offers three approaches to health profiling:

#### Option 1: Immediate Chat (No Profile Required)
- Start asking questions right away
- Receive general, evidence-based advice
- Complete profile later for personalized recommendations

#### Option 2: Complete Health Profile First
- Fill out the comprehensive health questionnaire
- Get personalized advice based on your specific situation
- Profile is saved permanently across sessions

#### Option 3: Skip Profile Setup
- Click "Skip Profile & Start Chatting" 
- Chat immediately with general advice
- Complete profile anytime later

### Health Profile Setup
When you choose to complete your health profile, the application guides you through:

#### Basic Information
- **Peptide Usage**: Whether you currently use any peptides
- **BPC-157 Specific**: Usage, dosage, and duration details

#### Health Details
- **Goals**: Select from tissue repair, injury recovery, gut health, etc.
- **Medical Conditions**: Track relevant health conditions
- **Medications**: List current medications and supplements

### Persistent Data

- Personal recommendations

## üß™ Testing & Development

### Manual Testing
1. Select each demo user and complete different health profiles
2. Test various conversation scenarios
3. Verify memory persistence across sessions
4. Check profile management features

### Conversation Testing
Try these example conversations:
- "What is BPC-157 and how does it work?"
- "I'm new to peptides, where should I start?"
- "What are the potential side effects I should watch for?"
- "Can you help me understand proper dosing?"

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Data Isolation**: Each user's data is completely separate
- **Local Storage**: Health profiles stored in application memory
- **Memory Management**: Conversations stored in Qdrant with user-specific isolation
- **No Authentication**: Demo mode only - no real user credentials stored

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service Initialization Error**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Service Initialization Error: Please check your environment variables
```
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check Qdrant connection (`QDRANT_URL`)
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Memory Service Issues**
- Restart Qdrant service
- Check Qdrant logs for connection errors
- Verify network connectivity to Qdrant URL

**Profile Not Saving**
