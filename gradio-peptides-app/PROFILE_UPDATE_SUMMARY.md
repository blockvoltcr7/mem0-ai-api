## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Database Integration
```python
def save_health_profile_to_memory(user_id: str, profile: UserHealth):
    """Save health profile to Mem0 for persistence."""
    # Stores profile data in Qdrant with metadata

def load_health_profile_from_memory(user_id: str) -> Optional[UserHealth]:
    """Load health profile from Mem0 if it exists."""
    # Retrieves and reconstructs profile from stored data
```
