# Mem0 Real World Example for AI Peptides Health Coaching

## Challenge to Solve

Currently large language models cannot retain memory of past conversations or events such as customers' health history, past interactions with the application, forms they filled out, events that occurred within the application which saves the users' interactions and health choices, etc.

## Solution

Mem0 allows storing contextual user information so that when the user chats or talks to an AI LLM, the AI can have context and better serve the customer's requests and inquiries, solve problems, or take action using tools.

## Proposed Solution

We need to use the user's unique identifier to always use for storing and searching data for a given user/customer. We will use **Qdrant database** (deployed on Railway) to test this in a real-world scenario.

### End-to-End Flow

User interacts with AI → User shares peptide information → AI stores information in Mem0 with Qdrant → User asks follow-up questions → AI retrieves stored memories and provides contextual responses

## Test Scenario: BPC-157 Peptide Coaching

### Background Information
BPC-157 is a peptide (part of a larger body protection compound) found in human gastric juice that has shown promising effects in animal studies, including:
- Accelerated wound healing
- Tissue repair
- Anti-inflammatory properties

**Important Note**: While not currently approved for human use, it has been investigated for various conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and soft tissue healing. Some websites and individuals advertise it for athletic performance, but these claims are not supported by medical literature or medical associations.

### Test Flow

1. **Initial Interaction**
   - User: "Hi!"
   - AI: Responds with greeting

2. **User Shares Peptide Information**
   - User: "I'm currently using BPC-157 for tissue repair and wound healing. I started taking it last week at 250mcg daily."
   - AI: Acknowledges the information and stores it in memory via Mem0/Qdrant

3. **Memory Retrieval Test**
   - User: "What peptide am I using?"
   - AI: Should remember and respond with BPC-157 information, demonstrating successful memory storage and retrieval

### Expected Outcomes

- ✅ AI successfully stores user's peptide information in Qdrant via Mem0
- ✅ AI can retrieve and recall specific peptide details when asked
- ✅ Conversation context is maintained across multiple interactions
- ✅ User-specific memory isolation works correctly

### Technical Implementation

- **Vector Database**: Qdrant (Railway deployment)
- **Memory System**: Mem0 with Qdrant backend
- **User Identification**: Unique user ID for memory isolation
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for responses
- **Testing Framework**: CLI-based interaction with comprehensive logging

### Success Criteria

1. Memory persistence across conversation turns
2. Accurate retrieval of peptide-specific information
3. Contextual responses based on stored memories
4. Proper user isolation (memories don't leak between users)
5. Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
