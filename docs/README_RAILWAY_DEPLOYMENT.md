# FastAPI Deployment to Railway.com üöÑ

This guide provides the **complete deployment strategy** for your FastAPI application to [Railway.com](https://railway.com/) - a modern cloud platform with superior developer experience.

## üéØ Why Railway Over Other Platforms?

‚úÖ **No Sleep Mode**: Unlike Render's free tier, Railway doesn't force apps to sleep  
‚úÖ **Superior UX**: Users consistently report the best deployment experience  
‚úÖ **Multiple Options**: 4 different deployment methods  
‚úÖ **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects and configures your app  
‚úÖ **Built-in Networking**: Easy service-to-service communication  
‚úÖ **Better Performance**: Faster deployments and more reliable infrastructure  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: UV Compatibility Note

Railway doesn't natively support the `uv` package manager. This guide includes Railway-optimized configurations that use standard `pip` for reliable deployment.

## üìã Pre-deployment Checklist

‚úÖ FastAPI application configured in `app/main.py`  
‚úÖ Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`  
‚úÖ `railway.json` configuration file created (Railway-compatible)  
‚úÖ Health check endpoint added (`/health`)  
‚úÖ Railway-optimized `Dockerfile` ready  

## üöÄ Deployment Options (4 Ways)

### Option 1: One-Click Template Deploy (Fastest - 30 seconds)

1. **Use Railway Template**
   - Go to [Railway FastAPI Template](https://railway.app/template/fastapi)
   - Click **"Deploy on Railway"**
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Your app is live in 30 seconds!

### Option 2: Deploy from GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to Railway with pip compatibility"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway**
   - Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click **"New Project"**
   - Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
   - Choose your repository
   - Click **"Deploy Now"**

3. **Configure Public URL**
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Networking**
   - Click **"Generate Domain"**
   - Your API is live at `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

### Option 3: Railway CLI (For Developers)

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   # or
   curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

### Option 4: Docker Deployment (Railway-Optimized)

Railway automatically detects the `Dockerfile` and uses it for deployment.

**Our Railway-optimized Dockerfile (uses standard pip):**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install dependencies using standard pip (Railway compatible)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create directory for allure results
RUN mkdir -p allure-results

# Expose port (Railway will set the PORT environment variable)
EXPOSE $PORT

# Run the FastAPI application
CMD uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Railway-Compatible Configuration Files

### Railway.json (Dockerfile Strategy)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Alternative: NIXPACKS Strategy

If you prefer NIXPACKS over Docker:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these endpoints:

1. **Root endpoint**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/`
   - Expected: `{"message": "GenAI API"}`

2. **Health check**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health`
   - Expected: `{"status": "healthy", "message": "API is running successfully"}`

3. **API Documentation**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/docs`
   - Interactive Swagger UI

4. **API v1 endpoints**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/v1/`
   - Your custom endpoints

## üîß Advanced Features

### Environment Variables
- Set in Railway dashboard under **Variables** tab
- Supports `.env` file upload
- Automatic secret management

### Custom Domains
- Add your own domain in **Settings** ‚Üí **Networking**
- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- No additional configuration needed

### Database Integration
- One-click PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Automatic connection string injection
- Built-in backup and scaling

### Monitoring & Logs
- Real-time logs in Railway dashboard
- Built-in metrics and monitoring
- Error tracking and alerts

## üö® Troubleshooting

### UV/UVicorn Issues

1. **UV Not Supported**
   - Railway doesn't natively support `uv` package manager
   - Use our Railway-optimized `Dockerfile` with standard `pip`
   - Remove any `uv` commands from build process

2. **Build Failures with UV**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå Don't use in Railway
   RUN uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # ‚úÖ Use instead
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Common Issues

1. **Port Configuration**
   - Railway automatically sets `$PORT` environment variable
   - Always use `--port $PORT` in your start command
   - Default port is dynamically assigned

2. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure `requirements.txt` is in repository root
   - Use standard `pip` instead of `uv`
   - Verify Python version compatibility
   - Review build logs in Railway dashboard

3. **App Won't Start**
   - Verify start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - Check that `app.main:app` matches your file structure
   - Review deployment logs

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Local testing with Railway environment
railway run python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Check Railway status
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Test with standard pip locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üéØ Migration from Render

If you're migrating from Render to Railway:

1. **Export Environment Variables** from Render dashboard
2. **Import Variables** to Railway dashboard
3. **Switch from UV to PIP** in build configurations
4. **Update Domain** in your frontend/client applications
5. **Test Thoroughly** before switching DNS

## üìà Scaling and Production

### Performance Optimization
- **Auto-scaling**: Railway automatically scales based on demand
- **Resource Allocation**: Configure CPU and memory limits
- **Geographic Regions**: Deploy close to your users

### Production Best Practices
- Use **environment variables** for all secrets
- Enable **health checks** for reliability
- Use **standard pip** for dependency management
- Set up **monitoring** and **alerts**
- Configure **custom domains** with SSL
